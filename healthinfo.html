   <h2>Health Info</h2>
   <p>A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lowers the risk of being 
   seriously ill or dying early. Health is not only just about avoiding 
   disease. It is also about physical, mental and social wellbeing. When 
   a healthy lifestyle is adopted, a more positive role model is provided 
   to other people in the family, particularly children. This booklet aims
   to help readers change their behaviour and improve their health in order 
   to live healthier, longer lives.</p>
